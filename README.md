As the [original documentation](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#file-extensions) suggesting `.njk` is the community adopted file extension:

> File Extensions
>
> Although you are free to use any file extension you wish for your Nunjucks template files, the Nunjucks community has adopted .njk.
>
> If you are developing tools or editor syntax helpers for Nunjucks, please include recognition of the .njk extension.
